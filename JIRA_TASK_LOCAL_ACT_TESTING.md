# JIRA Note: Enable Local Testing of CI Actions with act

**Task:** Document and support the use of the `act` tool for running and testing GitHub Actions workflows locally.

**Description:**
To improve development speed and reduce CI costs, the project now supports local testing of GitHub Actions workflows using the open-source `act` tool. This allows developers to simulate most workflow runs on their local machine before pushing changes to GitHub. Documentation has been added to guide users through installation, configuration, and common usage patterns for `act` with this repository's workflows.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Developers can install and configure `act` on their local machine.
- Example commands for running PR, push, and on-demand workflows are provided.
- Documentation covers secrets, environment variables, and limitations of local runs.
- Local test results are consistent with GitHub Actions runs for supported features.

**Results Comment:**
The `act` tool is now documented and supported for local CI workflow testing. Developers can validate workflow changes, debug issues, and iterate faster without waiting for remote CI runs. This enhancement streamlines the development process and helps catch issues early.
