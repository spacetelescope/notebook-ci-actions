# Critical JSON Parsing Fix - RESOLVED

## Issue Summary
**RESOLVED**: The `Process completed with exit code 5` error in the workflow summary generation has been **FIXED** and committed.

## Root Cause
The error was caused by malformed JSON in the workflow summary generation step on line 843 of `notebook-ci-unified.yml`:

```yaml
# PROBLEMATIC (caused exit code 5):
NOTEBOOKS="${{ needs.setup-matrix.outputs.matrix-notebooks }}"
```

When GitHub Actions substituted the variable, it created malformed JSON like:
```bash
NOTEBOOKS="["notebooks/hello-universe/..."]"  # Invalid - inner quotes not escaped
```

## The Fix Applied
**✅ FIXED** by changing the variable assignment to use single quotes:

```yaml
# FIXED VERSION:
NOTEBOOKS='${{ needs.setup-matrix.outputs.matrix-notebooks }}'
```

This creates valid JSON:
```bash
NOTEBOOKS='["notebooks/hello-universe/..."]'  # Valid JSON
```

### Additional Safety Measures
Also added extra fallback for jq parsing:
```bash
# OLD:
NOTEBOOK_COUNT=$(echo "$NOTEBOOKS" | jq -r 'length' 2>/dev/null)

# NEW:
NOTEBOOK_COUNT=$(echo "$NOTEBOOKS" | jq -r 'length' 2>/dev/null || echo "0")
```

## Testing Results
✅ **Verified Fix Works**: Tested with your exact failing data:
- 5 notebooks in the array parsed correctly
- No `exit code 5` error
- Fallback logic works if jq fails

## Files Changed
- `📝 .github/workflows/notebook-ci-unified.yml` - **Critical fix applied**
- `🧪 scripts/test-json-fix.sh` - Test script to verify fix
