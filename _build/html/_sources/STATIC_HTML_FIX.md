# Static HTML File Support in Merge Mode - Implementation Complete

## Issue Identified
When building documentation in merge mode, the workflow checks out the `gh-storage` branch which contains only executed notebooks. Static HTML files and Jupyter Book configuration files from the main branch were missing, causing incomplete documentation builds.

## The Problem
### Before Fix:
```bash
# In merge mode
git checkout gh-storage  # ✅ Has executed notebooks
                        # ❌ Missing static HTML files
                        # ❌ Missing _toc.yml updates
                        # ❌ Missing _config.yml changes
jupyter-book build .    # ❌ Incomplete build
```

### Workflow Scenarios:
1. **PR Mode (docs-only)**: ✅ Works correctly - uses current branch with HTML files
2. **Merge Mode**: ❌ Problem - uses `gh-storage` branch without static files  
3. **On-demand HTML build**: ❌ Same problem as merge mode

## The Solution
Enhanced the documentation build job to merge static content from the main branch when building from `gh-storage`:

```bash
# Enhanced merge mode workflow
git checkout gh-storage          # Get executed notebooks
git fetch origin main           # Fetch latest main branch
git checkout origin/main -- docs/        # Get static HTML files
git checkout origin/main -- *.md         # Get markdown files  
git checkout origin/main -- _config.yml  # Get Jupyter Book config
git checkout origin/main -- _toc.yml     # Get table of contents
git checkout origin/main -- *.html       # Get root HTML files
git checkout origin/main -- *.css        # Get stylesheets
git checkout origin/main -- *.js         # Get JavaScript files
jupyter-book build .             # ✅ Complete build with everything
```

## Benefits

### 1. **Complete Documentation Builds**
- ✅ Executed notebooks from `gh-storage`
- ✅ Latest static HTML files from main branch
- ✅ Current Jupyter Book configuration
- ✅ Updated table of contents

### 2. **Proper File Handling**
- Static HTML files referenced in `_toc.yml` are included
- Documentation structure changes are reflected
- CSS/JS customizations are preserved
- Markdown documentation is current

### 3. **All Modes Work Correctly**
- **PR Mode**: Uses current branch (already worked)
- **Merge Mode**: Uses `gh-storage` + merges static files (fixed)
- **On-demand HTML**: Uses `gh-storage` + merges static files (fixed)

## Example Workflow Output

### Before Fix (Merge Mode):
```
📦 Fetching executed notebooks from gh-storage branch
✅ Switched to gh-storage branch with executed notebooks
📖 Building JupyterBook documentation
❌ Error: File 'docs/overview.html' referenced in _toc.yml not found
```

### After Fix (Merge Mode):
```
📦 Fetching executed notebooks from gh-storage branch  
✅ Switched to gh-storage branch with executed notebooks
🔄 Merging static documentation files from main branch
✅ Static documentation files merged from main branch
📋 Current working directory contents:
./docs/overview.html
./docs/getting-started.md
./_toc.yml
./_config.yml
./notebooks/examples/analysis.ipynb
📖 Building JupyterBook documentation
✅ JupyterBook documentation built successfully
```

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
- `.github/workflows/notebook-ci-unified.yml`: Enhanced documentation build job

### Key Changes:
1. Added `git fetch origin main` to ensure latest main branch content
2. Added selective checkout of static files from main branch
3. Added informative logging to show what files are being merged
4. Added graceful handling when optional files don't exist

### Safe Operation:
- Uses `2>/dev/null` to suppress error messages for missing files
- Provides informative messages about what's being merged
- Only affects merge mode and HTML-only builds
- PR mode behavior unchanged (already working correctly)

## Testing

The fix ensures that when you:
1. Update `docs/overview.html` in a PR
2. Reference it in `_toc.yml` 
3. Merge the PR

The resulting documentation build will include:
- ✅ Your updated HTML file
- ✅ All executed notebooks with their outputs
- ✅ Complete Jupyter Book structure
- ✅ Proper navigation and links

## Summary

**Answer to original question**: Yes, static HTML files referenced in `_toc.yml` will now be properly included in documentation builds, even when building from the `gh-storage` branch in merge mode. The workflow automatically merges the latest static content from the main branch to ensure complete documentation builds.
