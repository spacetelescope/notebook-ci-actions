# Failure Handling with Warning Banners - Implementation Summary

## Problem
When running `full-pipeline-all` mode, if any notebook failed during execution, the entire process would stop and no documentation would be built or deployed. This was too strict for development workflows where you might want to see the results even with some failures.

## Solution Implemented
Enhanced the workflow to be more forgiving in `on-demand` mode while still maintaining strict validation for production workflows (PR/merge modes).

### Key Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced Build Documentation Condition
**File**: `.github/workflows/notebook-ci-unified.yml`
**Change**: Modified the `build-documentation` job condition to allow building even when `process-notebooks` fails, but only in `on-demand` mode:

```yaml
if: |
  always() && 
  inputs.enable-html-build == true &&
  (needs.setup-matrix.outputs.docs-only == 'true' || 
   inputs.execution-mode == 'merge' ||
   inputs.trigger-event == 'html' ||
   (inputs.execution-mode == 'on-demand' && (needs.process-notebooks.result == 'success' || needs.process-notebooks.result == 'failure')) ||
   (needs.process-notebooks.result == 'success' && inputs.execution-mode != 'merge'))
```

#### 2. Continue-on-Error for On-Demand Mode
**Addition**: Added `continue-on-error: ${{ inputs.execution-mode == 'on-demand' }}` to critical notebook processing steps:
- Validate notebook
- Security scan  
- Execute notebook

This allows individual notebook failures in on-demand mode without stopping the entire workflow.

#### 3. Automatic Warning Banner Injection
**New Step**: Added "Add failure warnings to notebooks" step that runs when:
- `inputs.execution-mode == 'on-demand'` 
- `needs.process-notebooks.result == 'failure'`

This step automatically injects warning banners into notebooks that may have failed execution.

**Warning Banner Content**:
```html
<div style='background-color: #fff3cd; border: 1px solid #ffeaa7; border-radius: 4px; padding: 15px; margin: 10px 0; border-left: 4px solid #f39c12;'>
<h3 style='color: #856404; margin-top: 0;'>⚠️ EXECUTION WARNING</h3>
<p style='color: #856404; margin-bottom: 0;'><strong>This notebook may not execute properly in the current environment.</strong></p>
<p style='color: #856404; margin-bottom: 0;'>Some cells may have failed during automated testing. Please review the notebook content and test manually before use.</p>
<p style='color: #856404; margin-bottom: 0; font-size: 0.9em;'><em>Generated during CI/CD pipeline - some outputs may be incomplete or missing.</em></p>
</div>
```

#### 4. Enhanced Workflow Summary
**Enhancement**: Updated the workflow summary to indicate when documentation was generated with warnings:

```yaml
if [ "$PROCESS_RESULT" = "success" ]; then
  echo "- **Status**: ✅ SUCCESS - All operations completed without errors" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
else
  echo "- **Status**: ❌ FAILURE - Some operations failed" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
  if [ "${{ inputs.execution-mode }}" = "on-demand" ] && [ "${{ needs.build-documentation.result }}" = "success" ]; then
    echo "- **Documentation**: ⚠️ Generated with warnings - failed notebooks marked with execution warnings" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
  fi
fi
```

#### 5. Test Script Enhancement
**File**: `scripts/test-on-demand-modes.sh`
**Enhancement**: Updated `full-pipeline-all` and `full-pipeline-single` test modes to include storage testing and provide clearer output about what's being tested.

#### 6. Documentation Updates
**File**: `scripts/README.md`
**Update**: Enhanced descriptions of `full-pipeline-all` and `full-pipeline-single` to clearly state they include storage and documentation building.

### Workflow Behavior by Mode

#### On-Demand Mode (`full-pipeline-all`)
- ✅ **Tolerant**: Continues execution even if some notebooks fail
- ✅ **Warns**: Adds warning banners to potentially problematic notebooks  
- ✅ **Builds**: Still generates and deploys documentation with warnings
- ✅ **Reports**: Clear summary of what succeeded/failed

#### PR Mode
- ❌ **Strict**: Stops on notebook failures (as intended for quality control)
- ❌ **No deployment**: Won't deploy broken documentation to production

#### Merge Mode  
- ❌ **Strict**: Uses pre-validated notebooks from gh-storage
- ✅ **Reliable**: Only deploys fully validated content

### Testing
Created comprehensive test script `scripts/test-failure-with-warnings.sh` that validates:
- Creation of failing notebooks
- Warning banner injection
- Documentation building with warnings
- Proper cleanup

### Benefits
1. **Developer-Friendly**: Allows seeing results even with some failures during development
2. **Safety**: Maintains strict validation for production deployments
3. **Transparency**: Clear warnings about potentially problematic content
4. **Comprehensive**: Still runs full pipeline (validation, execution, security, storage, documentation)
5. **Traceable**: Detailed workflow summaries explain what happened

### Use Cases
- **Development**: Test changes across all notebooks, see results even with some failures
- **Debugging**: Identify which specific notebooks have issues
- **Documentation**: Generate docs for review even when some notebooks need work
- **CI/CD**: Maintain continuous integration flow without blocking on individual notebook issues
