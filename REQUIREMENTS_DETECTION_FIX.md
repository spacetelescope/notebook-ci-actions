# Requirements File Detection Fix - Implementation Complete

## Issue Fixed
When a PR changes only a `requirements.txt` file, the workflow was showing:
```
üìä Matrix Setup Complete:
  Notebooks: []
  Affected Dirs: []
  Skip Execution: false  
  Docs Only: false
```

This was incorrect - requirements file changes should trigger testing of all notebooks in the affected directory since dependency changes can affect any notebook.

## Root Cause
The original logic detected requirements file changes and added directories to `AFFECTED_DIRECTORIES`, but it never actually populated the `CHANGED_NOTEBOOKS` array with notebooks from those directories.

## Solution Implemented

### Enhanced PR Mode Logic
1. **Requirements File Detection**: Properly detects changes to:
   - `notebooks/*/requirements.txt` (directory-specific)
   - `requirements.txt` (root level - affects all notebooks)
   - `pyproject.toml` (root level - affects all notebooks)

2. **Notebook Discovery**: After processing all changed files, the workflow now:
   - Searches all affected directories for `.ipynb` files
   - Combines explicitly changed notebooks with those in affected directories
   - Removes duplicates using associative arrays
   - Populates the matrix with all relevant notebooks

3. **Comprehensive Logging**: Added detailed logging to show:
   - Which requirements files changed
   - Which directories are affected  
   - Which notebooks were found in each directory
   - Final count of notebooks to process

### Code Changes Made

```bash
# NEW: After processing changed files, find notebooks in affected directories
if [ ${#AFFECTED_DIRECTORIES[@]} -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "üìÅ Finding notebooks in affected directories: ${AFFECTED_DIRECTORIES[*]}"
  declare -a ALL_AFFECTED_NOTEBOOKS
  
  for dir in "${AFFECTED_DIRECTORIES[@]}"; do
    echo "üîç Searching for notebooks in: $dir"
    while IFS= read -r notebook; do
      [[ -z "$notebook" ]] && continue
      echo "üìì Found notebook: $notebook"
      ALL_AFFECTED_NOTEBOOKS+=("$notebook")
    done < <(find "$dir" -name '*.ipynb' -type f 2>/dev/null)
  done
  
  # Combine and deduplicate notebooks
  declare -A UNIQUE_NOTEBOOKS
  for notebook in "${CHANGED_NOTEBOOKS[@]}" "${ALL_AFFECTED_NOTEBOOKS[@]}"; do
    [[ -n "$notebook" ]] && UNIQUE_NOTEBOOKS["$notebook"]=1
  done
  
  # Convert back to array and populate matrix
  CHANGED_NOTEBOOKS=()
  for notebook in "${!UNIQUE_NOTEBOOKS[@]}"; do
    CHANGED_NOTEBOOKS+=("$notebook")
  done
fi
```

## Expected Behavior Now

When you change `notebooks/examples/requirements.txt` in a PR, you'll see:

```
üîÑ PR Mode: Detecting changed files  
üì¶ Requirements file changed: notebooks/examples/requirements.txt
üìÅ Directory requirements file changed: notebooks/examples
üîç Finding notebooks in affected directories: notebooks/examples
üìì Found notebook: notebooks/examples/notebook1.ipynb
üìì Found notebook: notebooks/examples/notebook2.ipynb
üìì Found notebook: notebooks/examples/notebook3.ipynb
‚úÖ Matrix populated with 3 notebooks

üìä Matrix Setup Complete:
  Notebooks: ["notebooks/examples/notebook1.ipynb","notebooks/examples/notebook2.ipynb","notebooks/examples/notebook3.ipynb"]
  Affected Dirs: ["notebooks/examples"]
  Skip Execution: false
  Docs Only: false
```

## Benefits

1. **Proper Dependency Testing**: When requirements change, all affected notebooks are tested
2. **Smart Detection**: Distinguishes between root-level requirements (affects all) vs directory-specific
3. **No False Negatives**: Requirements changes will never be missed
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Ensures all notebooks that could be affected by dependency changes are tested
5. **Clear Logging**: Easy to see which notebooks are being tested and why

## Testing

Created and ran `scripts/test-requirements-detection.sh` which validates:
- ‚úÖ Requirements file changes are detected
- ‚úÖ Affected directories are identified correctly  
- ‚úÖ All notebooks in affected directories are found
- ‚úÖ Matrix is properly populated with discovered notebooks
- ‚úÖ Duplicate notebooks are handled correctly
- ‚úÖ JSON output is properly formatted

The fix ensures that dependency changes trigger appropriate notebook testing, preventing issues where updated requirements could break notebooks without being detected.
