# JIRA Note: Validate Fast Builds and Minimal Dependencies for hello_universe

**Task:** Validate fast builds and minimal dependencies for hello_universe

**Summary:**
Build times and dependency requirements for the hello_universe project were evaluated to ensure efficient CI runs and minimal environment complexity. The goal was to confirm that the project builds quickly and only requires essential dependencies.

**Details:**
- CI build times for hello_universe were measured and found to be within acceptable limits.
- The conda environment and requirements were reviewed for unnecessary or redundant packages.
- Test runs confirmed that only minimal dependencies are needed for successful notebook execution and validation.
- No excessive or unused dependencies were detected in the environment setup.

**Outcome:**
