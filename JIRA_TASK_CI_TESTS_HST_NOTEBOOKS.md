# JIRA Note: Run PR and Main Branch CI Tests (Including micromamba/conda Logic) for hst_notebooks

**Task:** Run PR and main branch CI tests (including micromamba/conda logic) for hst_notebooks

**Summary:**
Continuous Integration (CI) tests were executed for the hst_notebooks project on both pull requests and the main branch, with a focus on validating the micromamba/conda environment setup logic. This ensured that all code changes and merges are tested in a consistent and reproducible environment.

**Details:**
- PR-triggered CI workflows ran successfully for all recent pull requests.
- Main branch CI workflows executed after merges, confirming stability of the main codebase.
- micromamba/conda environment setup was validated for correct package installation and environment isolation.
- All notebook validation, execution, and security checks passed without errors.
- No regressions or workflow failures were observed during this testing period.

**Outcome:**
- CI coverage for hst_notebooks is confirmed for both PRs and the main branch, including environment logic.
- The project is ready for further development and safe merging of new contributions.

**Next Steps:**
- Continue monitoring CI runs for new PRs and merges.
- Address any issues promptly if they arise in future runs.
