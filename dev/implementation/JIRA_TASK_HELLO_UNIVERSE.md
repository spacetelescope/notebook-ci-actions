## Description

### Background

The hello_universe repository needs to be integrated into the centralized notebook CI/CD system managed by the notebook-ci-testing repository. This integration will enable automated testing, validation, and deployment of Jupyter notebooks in the hello_universe repository using reusable workflows.

### Business Justification

1. **Consistency**: Standardize CI/CD processes across all notebook repositories
2. **Maintainability**: Centralize workflow logic to reduce duplication and maintenance overhead  
3. **Quality Assurance**: Ensure all notebooks meet quality standards before deployment
4. **Automation**: Reduce manual testing effort and human error
5. **Scalability**: Enable efficient scaling of notebook testing infrastructure

### Technical Context
The notebook-ci-testing repository contains reusable GitHub Actions workflows that can be called by other repositories. The hello_universe repository contains educational Jupyter notebooks that need automated testing and validation.

---

## Reasoning

### Why This Task is Important
1. **Educational Repository Impact**: hello_universe serves as an introductory repository for new users learning notebook-based workflows. Ensuring its reliability through automated testing is crucial for user experience.

2. **Risk Mitigation**: Manual testing is prone to errors and inconsistencies. Automated CI/CD reduces the risk of deploying broken notebooks that could frustrate learners.

3. **Developer Productivity**: Automated workflows free up developer time from manual testing tasks, allowing focus on content creation and improvement.

4. **Quality Gates**: Implementing automated quality checks ensures notebooks execute properly across different environments and Python versions.

5. **Documentation and Examples**: hello_universe often serves as a reference implementation. Having robust CI/CD demonstrates best practices for other repositories.

### Strategic Alignment
- Supports the organization's goal of automated quality assurance
- Aligns with the initiative to centralize and standardize CI/CD workflows
- Contributes to improved developer experience and reduced maintenance burden
